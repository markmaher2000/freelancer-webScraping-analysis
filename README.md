# freelancer-webScraping-analysis

## Overview
#### This project involves scraping freelancer data from Freelancer.com and performing an analysis on the freelancers' performance. We gather information such as their skills, hourly rate, reviews, rating, and other key metrics to understand the patterns and insights that can help freelancers improve their performance on the platform.

## What Youâ€™ll Find in This Repository:
#### 1-Data Scraping: Python script using Selenium to scrape freelancer profiles based on various skills.
#### 2-Data Cleaning: Using Pandas to clean and organize the scraped data into a structured format.
#### 3-Analysis: Various statistical analyses and visualizations to understand trends like hourly pay across skills, ratings vs reviews, on-time delivery rates, and more.
#### 4-Data Export: Exporting the cleaned data to an Excel file for further analysis.

## Take Care!
#### Scraping may take a long time, especially if you are scraping multiple pages. To manage this, you can limit the number of pages the scraper navigates through. This can be done by modifying the get_freelancers function in the script, where c controls the page number (you can change it to limit the number of pages).
